                        AI is rapidly changing the landscape of work, making it an exciting time for programmers looking for something new. Hiring growth for AI specialists has grown 74% annually in the past 4 years. Because of its increasingly widespread adoption, AI specialists earned LinkedIn’s #1 emerging jobs spot. 
                            
                        There is crossover with machine learning here (which you’ll learn about next!), but the key difference is that AI is a broader concept pertaining to machines designed to act intelligently like humans, whereas machine learning relies on devices making sense of a specific set of data. 

                        In 2018, 31% of businesses said implementing AI was on their agenda for the next 12 months. Their top use cases are incorporating AI in data analysis and user experience.

From Siri and Alexa to chatbots to predictive analysis to self-driving cars, there are a ton of uses for this futuristic tech.     
                    Those who begin taking online courses in machine learning now will still be getting in relatively early, as demand is only increasing from here. According to McKinsey, 49% of companies are currently exploring or planning to use machine learning.

                    Machine learning can be applied to every industry, including healthcare, education, finance, etc. Translation? The possibilities are endless, and you can apply your machine learning skills to a role that suits your personality and interests.

84% of enterprises have launched advanced analytics and Big Data initiatives to accelerate their decision-making and bring greater accuracy. This is part of why data science has earned a top spot on LinkedIn’s emerging jobs report all three years the report has been conducted. 

Data analysis is the more entry-level skill, whereas data science gets more advanced, but the careers are still cousins. Industries needing data professionals span education, finance, health, software, and more.

Since 2015, the hiring growth rate of this technology job has increased by nearly 35% across a wide variety of industries. 

There's no better time for U.S. citizens to enter the field, due to changes in immigration laws. “Following recent government policy changes in the H1-B Visa application process, demand for US citizen data engineers has increased drastically and shows no signs of easing,” writes Sam Brown.

Cloud computing jobs are on the rise because more and more companies are switching from the classical server infrastructure to cloud solutions. According to Gartner, the market for public cloud services is projected to grow by 17% in 2020 to total $266.4 billion.

Amazon Web Services is one of these cloud platforms, featuring content delivery, database storage, networking, and more–over 50 services in total. Since it is currently the biggest platform, we’ll highlight some specific facts about AWS in this section (and give an extra course recommendation for it!).

AWS specialists are usually engineers, cloud architects, or system administrators. IT professionals who are AWS-certified earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It's one of the most profitable skills an IT employee can learn to level up their tech career, as AWS specialists earn an average of $113,000 (the highest of all certifications in the United States and Canada)

Virtual reality and augmented reality—the collective term is extended reality, or XR—are trending to be useful for more than just entertainment in the future. Marketing, advertising, health care, and manufacturing are some industries that have already begun adopting XR technology.

According to Hired’s 2019 State of Software Engineers report, demand for AR and VR engineers surged by an incredible 1,400%. But a little under just one year prior (from Feb ‘18-Feb ‘19), job searches had actually decreased by 13.48% for these roles. This implies that while jobs in this area are skyrocketing, the number of job-hunting candidates hasn’t had time to keep up, presenting a good opportunity for those who want to train for this top tech skill now. 

For the near future, AR is looking to outpace VR for growth and profitability. Reports predict that the global VR gaming market size will be worth $22.9 billion by the end of 2020, while AR will be worth a stunning $133 billion by 2022.

In the broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that “talk” to each other. 

“Simply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices—from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables—connected together,” says Matthew Evans, the IoT program head at techUK.

Everything that's connected to the internet can be hacked, which is why security is one top concern with these devices. California and the UK have both recently introduced legislation to make IoT devices safer and more secure. Cybersecurity professionals who specialize in IoT will likely be highly sought after for this reason.

While they're in the same family, UI and UX are different. UI (user interface) specialists design interfaces for websites and apps to be visually appealing, flow well, and be easy for users to navigate. UX (user experience) specialists do a lot of research and testing to consider every element of how the user will interact with the company and website, coordinating with developers and UI designers.

This type of career is perfect for those who want a creative-meets-analytical type of role (graphic design meets A/B testing and so on).

Ultimately, UI is better for those who want to focus on the visuals, layout, and general look and feel of a page or product. UX is better for those who want to use analysis and testing to help a business seamlessly meet their users' needs.

        <p> There are 3.5 billion smartphone users in the world today, and that number is continuing to grow every year. This means that companies who want to stay relevant don't just need websites; they need apps. Having mobile development skills also comes with the perk that if you can build apps for others, you can build and sell your own as well–so it's an ideal career path for aspiring entrepreneurs.

One interesting direction that mobile apps are headed in is augmented reality. Apps like Pokémon Go and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite game engage with the real world, blending technology and reality.

Originally devised for the digital currency Bitcoin, blockchain has evolved. The tech community is now finding other potential uses for the technology, such as peer-to-peer payments, crowdfunding, file storage, identity management, digital voting, etc. Learn more about blockchain/cryptocurrency jobs in this article.

“With platforms like Ethereum taking the lead, more and more companies need developers who understand the blockchain, smart contracts, and can build decentralized applications,” writes Anna Belaya. 

Some of the blockchain skills you should know include networking, cryptography computing, database design, and programming languages ranging from Java, JavaScript, and C++ to Go, Solidity, and Python.

                <span class="content">
        <p> If you’re okay with a little uncertainty in your career (and you enjoy science fiction), quantum computing is a field to consider. “The industry has a ways to go,” writes Sophia Chen. “They have a timeline, sort of, give or take a few decades. And at the moment, their roadmap has at least one glaring pothole: a lack of trained people.”

However, this provides an opportunity for you to help move the needle forward. Jeremy O’Brien, physicist and professorial research fellow at the University of Bristol, says that quantum computers could outperform everyday computers in less than 10 years.
